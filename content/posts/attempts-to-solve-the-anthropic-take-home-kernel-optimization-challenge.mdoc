# Baffonary with Anthropic Take one challenge.

So this is my attempt as a complete kernel and optimization noob trying to solve this optimization problem.

First Thing I did is to ask AI to help me understand what the basic problem is. At that time I was using claude. So I taked it to understand the whole codebase and add extensive comments on each page on how to understand/acive this problem.
One other thing that I did is to ask it to add links/resources that I might need to read to get the full context. I can't tell you that I've read all the resources that claude provide, but I'll provide you with both the initial starting point version, where there is nothing but resources and stuff to understand the problem, and the other one where I "try" to solve this problem.

============= Some more stuff here about how I understood the problem about how I read various things and how the debugger was really helpful to understand this problem. ==================

So this is my attempt as a complete kernel and optimization noob trying to solve this optimization problem.

Since I see the total limit of each blocks and each single instruction is packed in a different block. One of the simplest fix is that we will keep adding instructions until we reach the limit of each slots.
